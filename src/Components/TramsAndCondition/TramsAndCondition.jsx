In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Services is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed.You agree that Habot is not a party to any Service Contract between Users. Consequently, you understand and acknowledge that termination of this Agreement (or attempt to terminate this Agreement) does not terminate or otherwise impact any Service Contract entered into between Users. If you attempt to terminate this Agreement while having one or more open Projects, you agree (a) you hereby instruct Habot will close any open contracts; (b) you will continue to be bound by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service until all such Projects have closed on the Site and your access to the Site has been terminated; (c) Habot will continue to perform those Services necessary to complete any open transaction between you and another User; and (d) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the closure of any open Service Contracts, whichever is later, to Habot for any Services or such other amounts owed under the Terms of Service and to any Suppliers for any Supplier Services.

If your Account is temporarily or permanently closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or re-register for a new Account without Habot’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on the transparency of User's Account status to all Users, including you and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree that: if Habot decides to close your account temporarily or permanently, Habot has the right (but no obligation) where allowed by law to: (a) notify other users that have entered into Service Contracts with you of your closed account status, and (b) provide those users with a summary of the reasons for your account closure. You agree that Habot will have no liability arising from or relating to any notice that it may or may not provide to any user regarding closed account status or the reason(s) for the closure.
